    "- In the previous lesson, we learnt four basic arithmetic operations we can use in R programming. Here, I would introduce you to more advanced arithmetic operations that R can perform. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Exponentiation represented with the `^` sign\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Integer division represented by `%/%`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Modulo represented by `%%`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Exponentiation** - This involves raising a number to a power `n`. In other words, it is the multiplication of a number by itself raised to a certain number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer Division** - It refers to the maximum number of times that `n` can be found in `x` given that we have the integer division of `x %/% n`. Remember that `x` and `n` can be represented by integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modulo** - This returns the rest of the integer division of `x` by `n`. Therefore, in the case where we have a division with a remainder, the modulo operation returns this value."
