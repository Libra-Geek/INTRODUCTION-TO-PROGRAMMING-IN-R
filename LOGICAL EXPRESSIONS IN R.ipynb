    "- In the [introductory](https://github.com/Tess-hacker/INTRODUCTION-TO-PROGRAMMING-IN-R/blob/main/INTRODUCTION%20TO%20PROGRAMMING%20IN%20R.ipynb) and [second lessons](https://github.com/Tess-hacker/INTRODUCTION-TO-PROGRAMMING-IN-R/blob/main/ARITHMETIC%20EXPRESSIONS%20AND%20VARIABLES%20IN%20R.ipynb), we began our data science journey by learning the basics of programming in R, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Literals and data types: Logical, Numeric, Integer, and Character.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Arithmetic operators: addition `(+)`, subtraction `(-)`, multiplication `(*)`, and division `(/)`, Exponentiation `(^)`, Integer division `(%/%)`, and Modulo `(%%)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Some R syntax rules: R is case-sensitive, R allows only one instruction per line of code, and operator priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To do so, we were using the following dataset extracted from a fruit market dataset. This dataset contains, for each day (day), the available fruits (item), the number of fruits sold (item sold), and remaining (item available). It also contains the purchase price and selling price of these fruits and whether a day is a supply day or not (supply): \n",

    "- In this lesson, we'll use the fruit market dataset and build new programming skills on top of what we have learned so far dealing with logical expressions. Logical expressions are based on logical literals. We learned that there are two of them â€” \"true\" and \"false\". In R, we write respectively `TRUE` and `FALSE` or simply `T` and `F` (we will notice that all letters are in UPPERCASE just as we discussed in previous lessons. \n",
