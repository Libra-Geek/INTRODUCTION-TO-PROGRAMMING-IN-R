    "- In R, there are five categories of literal values which are: **Logical, Integer, Numeric, Character and Complex**. Here, we will be covering the logical literal values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical literal values are categorized into *true* and *false* values. In R, we write them **in uppercase characters** and represent them as **T** and **F** or **TRUE** and **FALSE**. TRUE can be represented with the number `1` while FALSE can be represented with the number `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical literals are typically used in R for testing. For example, to compare two values (greater, less, or equal). The logical value is the result of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The format of writing TRUE or FALSE matters a lot. They must always be in full caps i.e. FALSE, TRUE and not true,True, false, False, t, f. Let's try experimenting:"
